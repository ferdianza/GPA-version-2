# GPA-version-2

Hello my name is Ferdianza Yudha Negara

4 years ago I made GPAcount version 1
Back to this program in 2022, and I update the new version to count the GPA
1. I use def then make if else in loop to define Grade ABCDE to 4,3,2,1,0
2. I add the feature Remain Credit, so user can see remain credit from total credit. So to make error invalid total credit can be avoid
3. add commenting to comment gpa result.
